                        Obtaining metal pogs is a little different than collecting normal pogs.
                        Copper pogs can be earned through basic things like small favors or doing good on an assignment.
                        Silver pogs can be earned through trading 5 copper pogs. Also silver pogs can be earned by doing
                        bigger favors and attending after schools events such as prom, open house, or homecoming.
                        Golden pogs can be earned through trading 10 silver pogs. Also golden pogs allow you to ask
                        Mr.Smith for a resonable favor.
